# spyce

A DC circuit simulator based on modified nodal analysis. This simple program takes input a PSPice style netlist and outputs all the node voltages.
Only DC simulations can be performed. All sorts of dependent and independent sources have been considered and diode has also been considered as an example of a non-linear element.
